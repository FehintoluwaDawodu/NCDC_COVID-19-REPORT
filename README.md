## Project Overview
The dataset was sourced from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) website on June 20th, 2022, and contains detailed information on confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different states in Nigeria. Using Microsoft Power BI, I developed a dynamic dashboard that highlights key trends, regional distributions, and overall impact of COVID-19 in the country.


## Results 

- Data Cleaning and Transformation with Power Query to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

- Data Modeling to establish relationships between key variables such as states, cases, and outcomes.

- DAX Measures to calculate metrics like mortality rate, and morbidity rate.
